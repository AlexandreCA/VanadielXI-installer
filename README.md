### Development
* Update registry entries. You will need to collect registry entries which may be outdated in the future or have been changed if you have an old install of FFXI on an archived hard drive. Registry entries can be updated in `Script.nsi`. Search for `;Register with Windows` and update that section with the appropriate values from your retail install.
* Add a background. You'll need to add a background image for the installer with the .bmp format. This should be named `background.bmp`. Place this in the root folder of the project. (The same folder you find `Script.nsi`).
* Add an icon. You'll need to add an icon for the installer with the .ico format. This should be named `installer.ico`. Place this in the root folder of the project. (The same folder you find `Script.nsi`).
* Add a license. You'll need to add a text file for the installer with the .txt format. You can include anything you want to display to the user that they must accept before continuing through the setup process. This could be anything from disclaimers to rules. This should be named `license.txt`. Place this in the root folder of the project. (The same folder you find `Script.nsi`).
* Include data to be bundled with the installer. This will be the entire content of what is moved to the install directory the user chooses. It should include any data to play the game, and optionally, bootloaders or programs to use with the game. This should be compressed with a program like 7z into a archive named `data.pak`. Place this in the root folder of the project. (The same folder you find `Script.nsi`).
* Right click `Script.nsi` and then click "Compile NSIS Script" and then click "Test Installer" to see if it works.

### How to install
1. Ensure you have both the `installer.exe` and `data.pak` files.
2. Double click the installer.exe file and follow on screen instructions. Do not skip or cancel the automatic installation of dependencies.
3. Finally, reboot your PC and you should be good to go!
